I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.

What I enjoyed about this project was the creativity of making a website dedicated to delicious french fries.
What I struggled with was basically all of it. I wanted to create filter checkboxes for finding a perfect fry combination
but that took way longer then I expected and I had some issues with the hide and show functions as well as the flexbox side.
All in all it all took me a lot longer then expected and I ran out of time to keep making it better and working it to the point that
I wanted. I wasn't even able to do many of the extra credit parts because I wasted time on the javascript that I was stuck on.
I don't regret that, though, since I feel like I learned a lot by suffering.
